# `pilot`

Pilot is a fast, utilitarian, and verbose solidity REPL. It is heavily inspired by the incredible work done in [soli](https://github.com/jpopesculian/soli) and [solidity-shell](https://github.com/tintinweb/solidity-shell)!

## Why?

Ever wanted to quickly test a small feature in ylem?

Perhaps to test how custom errors work, or how to write inline assembly?

Pilot is a fully-functional Ylem REPL, allowing you to write, execute, and debug Solidity directly in the command line.

Once you finish testing, Pilot even lets you export your code to a new solidity file!

In this sense, Pilot even serves as a Foxar script generator.
